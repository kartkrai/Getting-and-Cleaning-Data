# Introduction
These set of files contain a run_analysis.R file containing the solution code for the week 4 Coursera assignment on getting and clearing data.In order to use the code, the user should download and unzip the raw data in the working directory and then source the run_analysis.R file.
# How it works
The unzipped filder "UCI HAR Dataset" containes the raw data along with activities and names of variables. The code retrieves data from there, extract the required data, merges datasets together, creates tidyset with labels and exports the dataset.
